# AlgoFlow

## Project Overview
The **AlgoFlow** is an Android application developed in Java to provide an interactive platform for visualizing and understanding fundamental data structures and algorithms. This project aims to assist students, developers, and educators in learning and teaching complex concepts through intuitive animations, step-by-step explanations, and hands-on experimentation. The app supports a variety of data structures (e.g. linked lists, stacks, queues, binary search trees...) and algorithms (e.g., sorting, searching, traversal) with real-time visualizations.

This project showcases my proficiency in **Android development**, **Java programming**, **object-oriented design**, and **algorithm implementation**, demonstrating my ability to build a user-friendly, performant, and educational mobile application.

## Features
- **Interactive Visualizations**: Animates the operations of data structures and algorithms (e.g., insertion, deletion, traversal) to illustrate how they work step-by-step.
- **Supported Data Structures**:
  - Arrays
  - Singly Linked Lists
  - Stacks and Queues
  - Binary Search Trees
  - Hash Table
- **Supported Algorithms**:
  - Sorting: Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort...
  - Searching: Linear Search, Binary Search
- **User Interface**:
  - Clean and intuitive UI built with Android XML layouts.
  - Interactive controls to input data, trigger operations
- **Educational Content**: Includes explanations for each data structure and algorithm.
- **Customizable Settings**: Users can adjust data size.
- 
## Tech Stack
